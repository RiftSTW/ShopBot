# ShopBot
Bot programmed in Node.JS that grabs the Fortnite item shop and puts them in a neat image and posts them on twitter!

Any problems? Feel free to tell me on my discord server! https://discord.js/GvHfG33

# Installation & Requirements

# Requires:

Node.JS
BurbankBigCondensed-Black font

Node.JS can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/ (It is recommended to download the LTS version)

You'll need to download BurbankBigCondensed-Black.otf for this to work! This is the font which Epic Games uses for Fortnite assets.

# Download Burbank Here:

- FontsMarket: https://www.fontsmarket.com/font-download/burbank-big-condensed-bold

# Installation:

Install all of the required packages by doing "npm install" (without quotations)

Go to app.js and go to line 26 and change all of the keys from line 26 through 29 to your Twitter API Keys.
Go to config.json and change your sac to yours (If you don't have one change it to something like "I don't have one.")
Once you have the font downloaded make a folder in the ShopBot directory named ".fonts" (without quotations) and put that font in there

Once your API Keys are in the app.js save the js file and do the same with your sac code in config.json load start.bat and watch the bot tweet the shop!
