# Installation & Requirements

# Requires:

Node.JS
fortniteapi.io api key
BurbankBigCondensed-Black font

Node.JS can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/ (It is recommended to download the LTS version)

FortniteAPI.io key can be generated here: https://fortniteapi.io/ All you need to do is sign up and go to the dashboard and you'll see it on the main page on the upper right corner

You'll need to download BurbankBigCondensed-Black.otf for this to work! This is the font which Epic Games uses for Fortnite assets.

# Download Burbank Here:

Go to app.js and go to line 21 and change the auth key to yours.


In app.js go to line 29 and change all of the keys from line 26 through 32 to your Twitter API Keys.

Go to config.json and change your sac to yours (If you don't have one change it to something like "I don't have one.")


Once you have the font downloaded make a folder in the ShopBot directory named ".fonts" (without quotations) and put that font in there

Once your API Keys are in the app.js save the js file and do the same with your sac code in config.json go to the final folder and delete the included shop then launch the start.bat!
